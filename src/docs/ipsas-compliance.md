# IPSAS Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines how the IPSAS Accounting System ensures compliance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The system is designed to meet the specific requirements of public sector entities while maintaining transparency, accountability, and comparability in financial reporting.

## IPSAS Standards Implementation

### IPSAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements

**Objective**: To prescribe the basis for presentation of general purpose financial statements to ensure comparability.

**Implementation**:
- **Entity Structure**: The system supports hierarchical entity structures (Government â†’ Agency â†’ Department)
- **Fund Accounting**: Proper segregation of resources through fund-based accounting
- **Financial Statement Components**: Support for Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial Performance, and Statement of Cash Flows
- **Comparative Information**: Historical data retention for comparative analysis
- **Materiality and Aggregation**: Configurable materiality thresholds for reporting

**Key Features**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Entity hierarchy support
interface Entity {
  entityType: 'GOVERNMENT' | 'AGENCY' | 'DEPARTMENT' | 'SUBSIDIARY'
  parentEntityId?: string
  fiscalYearEnd: string
}

// Fund segregation
interface Fund {
  fundType: 'GENERAL' | 'SPECIAL_REVENUE' | 'CAPITAL_PROJECTS' | 'DEBT_SERVICE'
  budgetAuthority: number
  carryForwardAllowed: boolean
}
\`\`\`

### IPSAS 2: Cash Flow Statements

**Objective**: To provide information about historical changes in cash and cash equivalents.

**Implementation**:
- **Cash Flow Categories**: Operating, Investing, and Financing activities classification
- **Direct/Indirect Method**: Support for both presentation methods
- **Cash Equivalents**: Proper identification and classification of cash equivalents
- **Restricted Cash**: Separate tracking of restricted cash balances

**Key Features**:
- Automated cash flow statement generation
- Real-time cash position monitoring
- Cash flow forecasting capabilities

### IPSAS 9: Revenue from Exchange Transactions

**Objective**: To prescribe accounting treatment for revenue arising from exchange transactions.

**Implementation**:
- **Revenue Recognition**: Proper timing of revenue recognition based on exchange nature
- **Measurement**: Revenue measured at fair value of consideration received/receivable
- **Service Revenue**: Recognition over time as services are rendered
- **Sale of Goods**: Recognition when significant risks and rewards transfer

**Key Features**:
\`\`\`typescript
interface Revenue {
  recognitionBasis: 'CASH' | 'ACCRUAL' | 'MODIFIED_ACCRUAL'
  revenueType: 'TAX' | 'NON_TAX' | 'INTERGOVERNMENTAL' | 'CHARGES_FOR_SERVICES'
  actualAmount: number
  collectedAmount: number
  outstandingAmount: number
}
\`\`\`

### IPSAS 17: Property, Plant and Equipment

**Objective**: To prescribe accounting treatment for property, plant and equipment.

**Implementation**:
- **Initial Recognition**: Cost model implementation
- **Subsequent Measurement**: Cost or revaluation model support
- **Depreciation**: Systematic allocation over useful life
- **Impairment**: Regular assessment for impairment indicators
- **Disposal**: Proper accounting for disposals and retirements

**Key Features**:
- Asset register maintenance
- Depreciation calculation automation
- Impairment testing workflows
- Asset disposal tracking

### IPSAS 24: Presentation of Budget Information in Financial Statements

**Objective**: To ensure public accountability by requiring comparison of budget and actual amounts.

**Implementation**:
- **Budget Integration**: Direct integration with budget preparation and execution
- **Variance Analysis**: Automated calculation of budget vs. actual variances
- **Explanatory Notes**: Support for variance explanations and notes
- **Budget Amendments**: Tracking of budget revisions and amendments

**Key Features**:
\`\`\`typescript
interface BudgetLine {
  originalAmount: number
  revisedAmount: number
  actualAmount: number
  encumberedAmount: number
  availableAmount: number
  
  // Calculated fields
  getVariance(): number
  getVariancePercentage(): number
}
\`\`\`

## Fund Accounting Implementation

### Fund Types

The system supports all major fund types as required by public sector accounting:

1. **General Fund**: Primary operating fund for general government activities
2. **Special Revenue Funds**: Specific revenue sources with legal restrictions
3. **Capital Projects Funds**: Major capital acquisitions and construction
4. **Debt Service Funds**: Principal and interest payments on long-term debt
5. **Enterprise Funds**: Business-type activities that charge fees
6. **Internal Service Funds**: Services provided to other departments

### Fund Segregation

\`\`\`typescript
// Proper fund segregation ensures:
class ChartOfAccounts {
  fundId: string // Each account belongs to specific fund
  requiresFundAccounting: boolean // Fund accounting requirement flag
  
  getFullAccountCode(): string {
    return `${this.fundId.substring(0, 2)}-${this.accountCode}`
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Accrual Accounting

### Revenue Recognition

The system implements proper accrual accounting principles:

\`\`\`typescript
enum RevenueRecognitionBasis {
  CASH = "CASH",           // Cash basis recognition
  ACCRUAL = "ACCRUAL",     // Full accrual basis
  MODIFIED_ACCRUAL = "MODIFIED_ACCRUAL" // Modified accrual for governmental funds
}
\`\`\`

### Expense Recognition

Expenses are recognized when:
- Goods or services are received
- Legal obligation is incurred
- Economic benefits are consumed

## Internal Controls

### Segregation of Duties

The system enforces proper segregation of duties through:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for different roles
2. **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for transactions
3. **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of all financial transactions

\`\`\`typescript
// Transaction approval workflow
enum TransactionStatus {
  DRAFT = "DRAFT",         // Initial entry
  PENDING = "PENDING",     // Submitted for approval
  APPROVED = "APPROVED",   // Approved but not posted
  POSTED = "POSTED",       // Posted to ledger
  REVERSED = "REVERSED"    // Reversed transaction
}
\`\`\`

### Authorization Controls

\`\`\`typescript
const PERMISSIONS = {
  CREATE_JOURNAL_ENTRY: "CREATE_JOURNAL_ENTRY",
  APPROVE_TRANSACTION: "APPROVE_TRANSACTION",
  POST_TRANSACTION: "POST_TRANSACTION",
  REVERSE_TRANSACTION: "REVERSE_TRANSACTION",
  VIEW_FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS: "VIEW_FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS"
}
\`\`\`

## Audit and Compliance Features

### Audit Trail

Every transaction includes comprehensive audit information:

\`\`\`typescript
interface GLTransaction {
  createdBy: string        // User who created
  approvedBy?: string      // User who approved
  postedBy?: string        // User who posted
  postedAt?: Date         // When posted
  reversedBy?: string     // User who reversed
  reversedAt?: Date       // When reversed
  reversalReason?: string // Reason for reversal
}
\`\`\`

### Compliance Validation

The system includes automated compliance checks:

\`\`\`typescript
class ComplianceService {
  async validateIPSASCompliance(entityId: string, fundId: string): Promise<{
    isCompliant: boolean
    violations: string[]
    recommendations: string[]
  }> {
    // Automated compliance validation
    // - Fund segregation validation
    // - Accrual accounting validation
    // - Revenue recognition validation
    // - Asset classification validation
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Reporting and Disclosure

### Financial Statements

The system generates IPSAS-compliant financial statements:

1. **Statement of Financial Position** (Balance Sheet)
2. **Statement of Financial Performance** (Income Statement)
3. **Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity**
4. **Cash Flow Statement**
5. **Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts**

### Notes to Financial Statements

Support for comprehensive notes including:
- Accounting policies
- Significant accounting judgments
- Commitments and contingencies
- Subsequent events

## Data Integrity and Security

### Data Validation

Comprehensive validation ensures data integrity:

\`\`\`typescript
// Journal entry validation
const journalEntrySchema = Joi.object({
  entries: Joi.array().min(2).items(entrySchema).required()
}).custom((value, helpers) => {
  const totalDebit = value.entries.reduce((sum, entry) => sum + (entry.debitAmount || 0), 0)
  const totalCredit = value.entries.reduce((sum, entry) => sum + (entry.creditAmount || 0), 0)
  
  if (Math.abs(totalDebit - totalCredit) > 0.01) {
    return helpers.error("custom.unbalanced")
  }
  return value
})
\`\`\`

### Security Measures

- Role-based authorization
- API rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
